    Notes :
    Examiner will set 9 questions in total, two questions from each
    section and one question covering all sections which will be
    Q.1. This Q.1 is compulsory and of short answers type. Each
    question carries equal mark (20 marks). Students have to
    attempt 5 questions in total, selecting at least one question from
    each session.
